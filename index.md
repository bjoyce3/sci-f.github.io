# Containers-FTW

Welcome to containers ftw, where you will find tools, standards, and competitions centered around containers. This is a base of tools and standards for the [Singularity](https://singularityware.github.io) organization.

## Standard Container Integration Format 
The Standard Container Integration Format (SCI-F) is a definition for the organization and file structure of a linux container. It's aim is to make containers **consistent**, **transparent**, **parseable**, and internally **modular**, both for developers and users.

## Container Apps
One compelling use case for SCI-F is to allow for easy creation, discoverability, and sharing of
helpers for containers. These helpers might include evaluation metrics, different execution contexts,
or internal modularity of software inside. We encourage you to browse and contribute to our
base of these apps:

## Competitive Containers
Another compelling use case is the ability to generate a base container, define a goal and a metric to assess success, and then have others contribute easily via pull requests (PRs) to the base. As an example of this, we have taken a Kaggle competition and created a [simple Github repo](https://github.com/containers-ftw/flavours-of-physics-ftw) that makes it easy for others to add a function, and submit a PR that is immediately assessed and compared to previous results. As another example of competitions, we kicked off the "containers-ftw" initiative with a fun competition at PEARC 2017:

 - [PEARC 2017 conference](https://www.pearc17.pearc.org/): was our first competition in New Orleans. The contest was a cow-y success! For more details and the winner, see the original (and updated) [competition announcement](competitions/2017/pearc.md)
