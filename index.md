## Competitive Containers

Welcome to containers ftw, where you will find tools and competitions centered around containers. We are announcing our first competition, the winner(s) to be announced at the [PEARC 2017 conference](https://www.pearc17.pearc.org/) in New Orleans. If you are an HPC admin in attendence, great! If you are a user at a center and can't attend, no problem, you can still enter and send along your institutional representative to claim your prize. For more details, see the [competition announcement](competitions/pearc2017.md)
