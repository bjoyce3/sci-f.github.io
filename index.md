# Containers-FTW

Welcome to containers ftw, where you will find tools and formats centered around containers and reproducible science.

## Scientific Filesystem
The Scientific Filesystem (SCIF) is a definition for a filesystem organization, environment, and control functions. It's aim is to make scientific applications **consistent**, **transparent**, **parseable**, and **modular**, both for developers and users.

## Container Apps
One compelling use case for SCIF is to allow for easy creation, discoverability, and sharing of
helpers for containers. These helpers might include evaluation metrics, different execution contexts,
or internal modularity of software inside. We encourage you to browse and contribute to our
base of these apps:
