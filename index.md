# Containers-FTW

Welcome to containers ftw, where you will find tools, standards, and competitions centered around containers. This is a base of tools and standards for the [Singularity](https://singularityware.github.io) organization.

## Standard Container Integration Format 
The Standard Container Integration Format (SCI-F) is a definition for the organization and file structure of a linux container. It's aim is to make containers **consistent**, **transparent**, **parseable**, and internally **modular**, both for developers and users.

## Competitive Containers

 - [PEARC 2017 conference](https://www.pearc17.pearc.org/): was our first competition in New Orleans. The contest was a cow-y success! For more details and the winner, see the original (and updated) [competition announcement](competitions/2017/pearc.md)

### Hosting
We are starting the documentation and work to allow you to host competitions for crowd sourced reproducible science. This is under development, but you can sniff around what we are planning and learn how it will be possible to [host a competition](hosting.md). For a complete and detailed walkthrough, go through our [hosting tutorial](hosting-tutorial.md) that transforms a Kaggle Competition into a competitive container.
