# Competitive Containers

Welcome to containers ftw, where you will find tools and competitions centered around containers. 

## Competitions
We are announcing our first competition, the winner(s) to be announced at the [PEARC 2017 conference](https://www.pearc17.pearc.org/) in New Orleans. If you are an HPC admin in attendence, great! If you are a user at a center and can't attend, no problem, you can still enter and send along your institutional representative to claim your prize. For more details, see the [competition announcement](competitions/2017/pearc.md)


## Hosting
We are starting the documentation and work to allow you to host competitions for crowd sourced reproducible science. This is under development, but you can sniff around what we are planning and learn how it will be possible to [host a competition](hosting.md)
